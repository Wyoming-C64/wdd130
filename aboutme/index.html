        <h2>Mike Lewis</h2>
        <p>At the age of 6, I wrote my very first computer program on our family's new home computer. I was instantly hooked, and computers became my second hobby, next to my toy and model trains.</p>
        <p>Although I originally planned to get a degree in computer science my first time through college, I was sidetracked into getting an associate's degree in graphic design. It has treated me well, but now I want to finish what I started. The timing was right as my previous employer went bankrupt right after I finished completing the Pathway Connect program.</p>
        <p> I recently accepted a position as a technology facilitator for a business IT services company. It fits nicely with my pursuit for my bachelor's degree, which I expect to complete later next year.</p>
