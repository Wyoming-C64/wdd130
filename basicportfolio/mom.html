                <h2>Dedicated to Mom</h2>

                <p>The first computer we had in our home was supposed to be a birthday present to my mom. It started out that way, but a little blonde-haired, 6-year-old boy was extremely fascinated by it, and I wasted no time learning how to use it... <i>and program it!</i></p>

                <p>Mom did as much as she could to learn to use it as well, and she spent many, many afternoons and nights typing in BASIC programs that could be found in the various computer magazines published at the time. Most of them came from <b>COMPUTE!</b> and <b>COMPUTE!'s Gazette</b>, but another favorite was <b>Family Computing</b> which usually focused on more educational and family-oriented programs.</p>

                <p>When mom saw how well I was learning to program the computer, she knew I had a gift and a talent that would benefit me my whole life. I remember the day that I decided to change majors from computer science to computer graphic design... I think at first she was a little disappointed, but she quickly supported me and realized that I would still be working with computers.</p>

                <p>I only managed an associate's degree in graphic design as my life took off immediately after graduation. Two years ago I decided to go back to school through the BYU Pathway program and finish the bachelor's degree I originally started in computer science and applied technology. Mom had been struggling with some health issues, but was excited for me to be back in school.</p>

                <p>Mom passed away from a surgical complication one week before my first semester started.</p>
            
                <p>This website is dedicated to her, because she let me explore and learn on this wonderful little computer.</p>
