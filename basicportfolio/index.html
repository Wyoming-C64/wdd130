                <h2>Greetings, User!</h2>

                <p>You are here for one of two reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Through a search or other means, you saw a link to this site talking about a guy who taught himself to program a computer in the early 1980s at the age of 6. You thought that was interesting... Now here you are.</li>
                    <li>Somehow, you accidentally found this site... And now you just read that a guy taught himself to program a computer some 40 years ago at the age of 6... Which is still interesting.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>You might be wondering about that age 6 thing, thinking, &ldquo;What did he learn? How did he learn it? What creative programs did he write once he learned something?&rdquo; Don't worry... Those questions—and maybe some others—will all be answered here.</p>

                <p>This website showcases my original programs written in Commodore BASIC version 2 for the <b>COMMODORE 64</b> home computer, which celebrated its 40th birthday this year. Here you will see screen and selected video captures of the programs in action, as well as the source code ("program listings") along with some explanations.</p>
                
                <p>This site is the only site in the world where you will find the computer programs that I wrote while growing up in the 1980s. I have also included a section for selected programs I have written recently as an adult, primarily for the <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/User:RR-GraphixGuy" target="_blank" title="Visit the Rosetta Code Project">Rosetta Code</a> project. This site showcases those programs in action as well.</p>
                
                <p>The only thing required from you, dear User, is your curiosity. No personally identifiable information is collected, so feel free to explore any area you want.</p>
