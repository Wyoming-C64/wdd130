                <div class="home-text">
                    
                <p>About five or so years ago, I discovered the website at <a href="https://rosettacode.org/" title="Click here to visit the Rosetta Code!" target="_blank">rosettacode.org</a>. It is a wiki-based website, and the introduction on the home page explains it best:</p>

                <blockquote>“Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site. The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another” (Rosetta Code, 2022).</blockquote>
                
                <p>This intrigued me, and as I started browsing some of the tasks, I discovered that dialects of BASIC from 8-bit machines were represented for as many tasks as those machines were capable of completing. There were already some entries for Commodore BASIC, so I created a user account. On days that I traveled on overnight trips for work, I would spend the evenings in my hotel running the VICE emulator on my modern computer and creating translation entries for Commodore BASIC.</p>
                
                <p>In the last four years, I have contributed to 50 programming tasks with Commodore BASIC implementations, most of them in Commodore BASIC V2. My favorites are chosen either because of the unique solution to the problem, or because the task showcases the features (or limits) of the Commodore 64.</p>

                        <p>The goal is to figure out how many combinations of coins (pennies, nickles, dimes, and quarters) can be used to make $1.00. This was based on BASIC code already submitted for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. After directly porting this to Commodore BASIC, I was disappointed to see that the algorithm took 46 minutes and 37 seconds to arrive at a solution. After thining about the problem, I was able to get the time down to 2 minutes and 12 seconds. Open this program for more details.</p>

                        <p>This is the classic nursery song... Sung programatically! I had some fun with this one. The version of BASIC (version 2) on the Commodore 64 is not as robust as it was on later computers like the Commodore 128, which used version 7. I decided to build a music interpreter similar to the one that came built in to Commodore BASIC version 7.</p>

                        <p>The task was to programatically demonstrate all of the video modes available on whatever computer the program is running on. No high definition here... The Commodore 64 was limited to either 320x200 pixel resolution and a 16-color palette. There were also multi-color modes that allowed for a toal of four colors to be displayed within a single 8x8 block of pixels, but this decreased the horizontal resolution by half.</p>

It is more informative to look at a copy of the code while running the program. At some point I will do a better version of the program for this website that explains what is going on.</p>

                        <p>You are given four random digits ranging from 1 through 9. Your goal is to use arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) along with parentheses to make the resulting value equal 24. The ZX Spectrum solution took advantage of a feature not available on the Commodore 64, but I found my own solution that I thought was pretty clever, and this became my first self-modifying BASIC program.</p>

                        <p>The goal is to have a piece of machine code execute from within the language you are programming in. This was done all the time on the Commodore 64 to provide much faster processing within BASIC programs. This example simply has the machine code add two numbers.</p>

                        <p>The goal of this program is to demonstrate displaying and modifying the system time of day clock. I actually wrote two different programs because there are two different ways the Commodore 64 can keep time&mdash;the common one is software based, the other is hardware based. This is the hardware-based version that uses the clock built into both of the Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) chips in the Commodore 64.</p>

                        <p>This is actually not a submission to Rosetta Code, but is an independent project that I did based on a YouTube video from the 8-bit Show and Tell channel by Robin Harbon.</p>
                        <p>Normally, the LIST command is intended to be an immediate mode command. Using it within a program causes a program to stop executing after the the LIST command. I figured out a way to hack it, and then I put it to good use to show off all but one of the possible error messages on the Commodore 64.</p>
