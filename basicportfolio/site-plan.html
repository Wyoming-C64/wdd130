      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I started programming my family's first home computer when I was 6 years old. This website will showcase the programs that I wrote from that point on as I taught myself computer programming. The programs are written in Commodore BASIC version 2.0, which was built into the ROM of every Commodore 64 computer. This all took place during the 1980s, which was an exciting time to witness and participate in the revolution of the personal home computer.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience is anyone who wants to know what kind of computer programs I wrote when I was a kid, and anyone who wants to know
        what programming a computer was like in the early 1980s.
