                    <p>Although I had been alive only six years, my world drastically changed when my mom received a birthday gift in September 1982â€¦ A home computer system.</p>

                    <p>The Commodore 64 was released only a month before but had been hyped up since January. It featured 64k of RAM, 320x200x16 bitmapped graphics, programmable hardware "sprites", 3-channel synthesized audio, and an MSRP roughly half that of its competitors. With all of that in its favor, the Commodore 64 set the Guinness World Record for Best-selling Desktop Computer.</p>

                    <p>I watched my parents start up the computer and go through the Commodore 64 User&rsquo;s Guide to learn how to use the computer. The majority of the manual introduces new owners to the BASIC programming language and provides sample programs that showcase many of the computer&rsquo;s features.</p>

                    <p>Being the precocious child I was, I thought, <i>I can do that too</i>, and opened the User&rsquo;s Guide to learn for myself. By the time I completed elementary school, I had learned enough to be able to write a small, but useful application to inventory my model trains.</p>

                        <p>This is the very first program I wrote entirely on my own based on what I had learned. Be prepared for the nonsense of a 6-year old. Key concepts that I had learned at this point are output to the screen, input from the user, and changing the screen and text colors.</p>

                        <p>I wrote this program after learning about IF... THEN statements. At this point, I have also just barely grasped the concept of evaluating variables, and I know how to modify the screen colors through the VIC-II registers. For some reason, it did not occur to me to use a numeric variable instead of a string for the user input.</p>

                        <p>Writing computer programs is fun, especially when you can amaze your friends... And throw some shade on your enemies. To be fair, "Camron" (Cameron) and George started picking on us first and were quite the bullies. I wonder if Kevin ever became a ninja?</p>

                        <p>Unlike "Prediction", this fortune teller is not targeted at anyone specific for certain fates. The program asks for your name only as a courtesy, and the fortunes are all completely random.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, at this time I do not have a complete working copy of this program. I was able to salvage only the title screen and the instructions. At least this is enough to show the intent of the game. Basically, move around the screen and pick up as many points as you can before the time runs out.</p>

                        <p>About six years after my very first programming experience, I finally wrote a useful application. This was done at the request of my father who was working many long hours in private practice as an optometrist. Unfortunately, some of his patients were way behind on their bills, and he needed a calculator to figure out what was owed after factoring in interest, processing, and other fees, as well as how long the bill was past due.</p>

                        <p>By now, the Commodore 64 was becoming a thing of the past as more people were settling with either IBM PC DOS-compatible or Apple Macintosh computers as their home computer.</p>
                        <p>This was the last big program I wrote and mostly completed on our Commodore 64 before it was put in storage. I wanted a database to keep track of all of my HO scale model trains, so I decided to build one from scratch.</p>
