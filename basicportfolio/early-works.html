                    <p>Although I had been alive only six years, my world drastically changed when my mom received a birthday gift in September 1982... A home computer system.</p>

                    <p>The Commodore 64 was released only a month before but had been hyped up since January. It featured 64k of RAM, 320x200x16 bitmapped graphics, programmable hardware "sprites", 3-channel synthesized audio, and an MSRP roughly half that of its competitors. With all of that in its favor, the Commodore 64 set the Guinness World Record for <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/72695-most-computer-sales" target="_blank">Best-selling Desktop Computer</a>.</p>

                    <p>I watched my parents start up the computer and go through the Commodore 64 User&rsquo;s Guide to learn how to use the computer. The majority of the manual introduces new owners to the BASIC programming language and provides sample programs that showcase many of the computer&rsquo;s features.</p>

                    <p>Being the precocious child I was, I thought, <i>I can do that too</i>, and opened the User&rsquo;s Guide to learn for myself. By the time I completed elementary school, I had learned enough to be able to write a small, but useful application to inventory my model trains.</p>

                        <p>By now, the Commodore 64 was becoming a thing of the past as more people were settling with either IBM PC DOS-compatible or Apple Macintosh computers as their home computer.</p>
                        <p>This was the last big program I wrote and mostly completed on our Commodore 64 before it was put in storage. I wanted a database to keep track of all of my HO scale model trains, so I decided to build one from scratch.</p>
