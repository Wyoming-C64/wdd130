                    <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River</h3>
                    <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p>
                    <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>
                    
                    <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                    <h2>Utah</h2>
                    <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyons</h3>
                    <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.</p>

                    <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                    <h3>Wind River and Shoshone River Combo</h3>
                    <p>This two-venue, two-day tour includes overnight lodging and bus transportation â€” perfect for your Yellowstone vacation!</p>

                    <p>Start your adventure at the majestic Wind River Canyon. At high water levels, rapids in the Wind River Canyon can reach Class V. Just outside Thermopolis, WY, the 12-mile stretch of river is fast and steep, but also offers some world-class scenery, and will take only a couple of hours.</p>

                    <p>Afterward, enjoy an overnight stay at the Hot Springs Hotel & Spa, which is a mere walking distance from the legendary Hot Springs State Park.</p>

                    <p>Our chartered bus will take you to Cody, WY the next morning. Just outside Yellowstone National Park, the Shoshone River offers some of the best chances for wildlife viewing in the state. A day trip through the Red Rock Canyon is both scenic and exciting. Rapids don't get bigger than Class III, making it a great option for families.</p>
