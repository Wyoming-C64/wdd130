    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The patrons of this website are people who love outdoor adventures of any kind and are willing to do thrilling activities. Experience of the patrons may range from little-to-none all the way to "expert thrill seeker". They are also people who either live in the intermountain region, or are visiting for vacation and leisure time. They are people who have discretionary funds to afford outdoor adventure activities for themselves and their families, but do not necessarily want to invest in purchasing and maintaining their own rafting equipment and safety gear. They are looking for someone to provide the experience, equipment, and logistics to safely enjoy an occasional whitewater adventure.</p>
